# Thoughts and Updates #1 - New Look, Web Design, and more!

_Tristan Goodell on Update | 17 Aug 2018_

For a while now, https://tristangoodell.com has used two different themes throughout its lifespan: [Mapache](https://github.com/godofredoninja/Mapache) and [Odin](https://github.com/h4t0n/odin). I really liked Mapache, however comments would not work in the way that I wanted. Odin was an okay theme. I really liked the social sharing options, but really didn't like some of the design decisions.

So, I decided to fork Odin and [create my own theme](https://github.com/tgoodell/New-Home). You might notice that everything looks quite a bit different though.

I liked how Odin looked; I just thought that I could make it look better. The plan for the new theme for this website is quite simple: I will periodically update some of the theme over time. Hopefully, it will get to the point where everything is new and different and nothing of Odin remains.

I wanted to roll out this new theme over time because I do not want to take a break from my other projects for a good week or two to completely write everything from scratch, This way, I can make changes and improve this theme at my own pace.

Enough about themes: let's talk about some of the other changes to https://tristangoodell.com.

I have decided to pivot from this site just being a blogging site to being a site that will host most of my future projects and ventures. The first endeavour that I certainly want to get setup is my web design service (name pending).

Ideally, I will have up a couple of example sites (which I'll talk about later in this blog post) up in the next month or so. The one key thing that I believe I am missing at this point in time is formal experience: sure, I have built this website and a few offline projects prior to this, however I really don't think that counts.

Another thing that has been on my mind for a while is what to exactly call this branch of https://tristangoodell.com and what to call what I do. Am I a web developer or a web designer?

According to [mockplus.com](https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/web-designer-vs-web-developer), a web designer is:

> "[...]responsible for the design of the visual layout of websites. Excellent designers are good at the using of a variety of concepts, such as color collocation, typesetting, spatial relations and user experience."

Likewise, a web developer is:

 > "[...] generally considered as a [person] who use[s] the left brain to develop the coding of products. Under normal circumstances, Web developers get the design of the page from the Web designer and then use front-end development technology to encode these pages. They do not really care if the page looks good or not, but they care about the clean code very much. Outstanding developers are always paying more attention to details and focusing on each of them."

To sum up:

- A web designer wants to make the website look pretty.
- A web developer wants the website to function.

The issue here is that I want my sites to both look pretty and be functional. So, I guess I am a Web Designer Developer until I get a better name.

The other part of this debate is what to exactly call this branch. Currently, it is simply called "Web Design". To me, this isn't a very captivating name. So, I need to work on that. I would really appreciate it if you left any suggestions in the comments.

The other branch of https://tristangoodell.com that I am not so sure about is Consulting. As you can see on my home page, Consulting is listed there with three different tiers: Personal, Business, and Enterprise.

I really like the idea about consulting others, however there are several reservations that I have. First, I once again don't have any formal experience in this department. I have helped a few startups out with ideas to refine their goals and business models along with giving quite a bit of advice to friends. I am just unsure if any of that gives me any ounce of credibility.

Next, I have no idea what I would even charge. There are three options in my eyes:

- Charge by the hour
- Charge by the tier/job
- Simply don't list the price. Charge whatever the customer wants to pay.

All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. By the hour will probably be better for me if it takes quite a long time to do. On the other hand, if a task only took an hour or two, it could end up being less than charging by the tier/job or charging what someone is willing to pay. By the tier/job will arguably be better for the client: it is transparent and will most likely end up being less than the other two options. Finally, a charge depending on who the customer is could be great for certain clients and not so great for others.

I really don't have an answer for what the best option is. This contemplation also applies for the web design branch, however, I think I can work out something there.

I will certainly keep you posted.

I think that I need to wrap this up soon. I will leave you with a brief list of other projects I am in the middle of initiating:

I purchased 5 testing domains to showcase a couple of different projects of mine:

- appin.space : a website showcasing a new cool app.
- photostakenin.space : a website displaying how a photographer could present their photos.
- portfolioin.space : a mock portfolio for a new graduate or a veteran deep within their career.
- tastein.space : a website that houses all of the necessary information for an up and coming restaurant.
- blastingoffinto.space : a website meant for pure experimentation for some future project.

I am excited to see how each website will morph into something magnificant.

Finally, I am thinking about restructuring the layout of this website. Several of the pages here have a .html extension in its URL. I want to fix that along with perhaps completely moving the blog to either https://blog.tristangoodell.com or https://tristangoodell.com/blog. Currently, the blog is hosted on the latter, however, it is interpreted as a tag, which is quite limiting.

Anyway, I hope to see you again next week. Posts are normally each Friday, however I got preoccupied with the redesign.

Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TristanGoodell) and check out my [Github](https://github.com/tgoodell) if you are interested in any of my coding projects.

Thanks for reading!
