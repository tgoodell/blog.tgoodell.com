# Joining TSA

_Tristan Goodell on [School](../tags/school.html) | 24 Jan 2019_

I decided to finally join my high school’s TSA club. Not the Transportation Security Administration: the [Technology Student Association](https://tsaweb.org/). My cousin has had a great experience in her chapter and has been suggesting that I join my local chapter for quite a while. 

For those of you who do not know, the Technology Student Association is an international organization that:

> [...] enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.

In other words, you apply STEM skills to different projects and competitions. A few noteworthy events are “Webmaster”, “Digital Video Production”, and “Video Game Design”. 

“Webmaster” involves a team of three to five designing, building, and launching a website that relates to the given theme. In this case, “[Celebrating the Music](https://tsaweb.org/docs/default-source/themes-and-problems-2018-2019/themes/tsa-high-school-webmaster-design-brief-2019.pdf?sfvrsn=db347459_2)”. It appears that the goal is to develop a website for a band or musician. Seems interesting. I have a decent amount of experience building websites from scratch. I think that I would perform pretty well in this format. 

Although there is not a listed number of participants for “Digital Video Production”, I know for sure that this can potentially be a solo event. This competition warrants the creation of a “Mockumentary”. A Mockumentary Depicts fiction in the style of a documentary. That is a peculiar way to tell a story. I have a little bit of experience with the video editor [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/), but creating a film such as this requires more skills than just video editing. Participating in this event would primarily be a learning experience. 

Finally, we have “Video Game Design”. A team of three develop a video game that focuses on a chosen theme. Said theme is a role playing game (RPG) that is TSA focussed. According to the video provided, an RPG is a video game ‘where the player controls the actions of a character and/or the actions of several party members in a well-defined world’. “TSA focussed” can apparently be as simple as TSA icons appearing in the game. I can see this event end up as a superb learning experience for myself. I have toyed with the idea of building my own video game (I sort of did a few years ago; it was not very good). This would give me an excuse to do it.

Overall, I am pretty excited to join TSA. It will be a novel experience that I believe will be quite captivating. I am wanting to branch out to different clubs and activities since, prior to this, I have really only actively participated in the [Maumelle Debate and Speech Club](https://maumelledebateandspeech.club/). I dabbled with Quiz Bowl and NJHS, however those never went anywhere. 

Well, I will keep you posted. Thanks for reading!
