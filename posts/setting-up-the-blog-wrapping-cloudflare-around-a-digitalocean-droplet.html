      <h1>Setting Up the Blog - Wrapping Cloudflare Around a DigitalOcean Droplet</h1>
      <i class="tags-date">Tristan Goodell on <a href="../tags/project.html">Project</a>, <a href="../tags/website.html">Website</a>, <a href="../tags/cloudflare.html">Cloudflare</a>, <a href="../tags/digital-ocean.html">Digital Ocean</a> | 03 Aug 2018</i>
      <p>I have been wanting to construct a blog for quite a while; a place to document my various projects and goals with the hope that I can maybe help others reach their own goals.</p>

      <p>I really didn't want to use WordPress for my blog. It is much too bloated and slow for my purposes. I wanted to use something that was snappy and super fast.</p>

      <p>I considered several options: Pico CMS, Anchor CMS, or Grav CMS; however, at the end of the day, I decided to use Ghost for my blog.
      <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a> uses Ghost Pro for his blog, and his blog is beautiful. He makes a very compelling argument for <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/its-a-new-blog/">why he went with Ghost Pro, rather than hosting it on his own</a>.</p>

      <p>I really did not want to have to pay $79 a month for <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost Pro</a>, when I could host my own with <a href="http://pages.news.digitalocean.com/dcn/AyKQ30vur1Nt8H30LIWxk-j5xHmafGnoECQwn1ooO75-n4tuZXTwGdYjSIr5qbK0xTcckfnLm_U1fCT4uON9bg==/Y0Vs207XI00WN0236IE03D7">Digital Ocean</a> for only $5 a month. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/customers/ghost/">GhostPro actually uses Digital Ocean</a> for their hosting.</p>

      <p>So, I went ahead and activated a droplet with the <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/ghost/">Ghost one-click app</a>. Setup was a breeze. I went to my email, grabbed the IP address I was given, pasted it into Firefox, and was greeted with a message saying that I needed to set up my Ghost instance.</p>

      <p>I typed in <code>ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> into my terminal, entered the password that was given to me, and then changed it to a new one. Next, I typed in several lines into my terminal to finish the backend setup process.</p>

      <h3 id="sshintoyourdroplet">SSH into your Droplet</h3>

      <p><code>ssh root@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> where <code>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> is your Droplet's IP Address.</p>

      <h3 id="switchtouserghostmgr">Switch to user ghost-mgr</h3>

      <p><code>sudo -i -u ghost-mgr</code></p>

      <h3 id="gotothedirectorywhereghostisinstalled">Go to the directory where Ghost is installed</h3>

      <p><code>cd /var/www/ghost</code></p>

      <h3 id="updateghost">Update Ghost</h3>

      <p><code>ghost update</code></p>

      <h3 id="configureghost">Configure Ghost</h3>

      <p><code>ghost setup</code></p>

      <p>Follow the prompts and you'll be finished there.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>It was now time to set up everything else. I navigated to https://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/ghost to begin configuring what visitors to my website would see.</p>

      <p>I set up my administrator account with all of the right credentials and a strong password. Next, I simply skipped the invitation to invite other writers to this blog (I will be the only one writing here). The initial setup process was finished.</p>

      <p>I now wanted to wrap <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> around my blog and actually connect my domain https://tristangoodell.com to my Droplet.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>On DigitalOcean, I navigated to Networking --> Domains. I then proceeded to type in my domain tristangoodell.com into the box with the placeholder "Enter Domain" (NOTE: you cannot type in the protocol; https / http). You will be greeted with a screen that features a DNS record. You can either connect your Domain to DigitalOcean's DNS or connect your domain to Cloudflare.</p>

      <p>I wanted my blog to be as fast as possible, so I connected my domain to Cloudflare's DNS and set up everything over there. <a href="https://httpsiseasy.com/">Here is a great guide</a> by Troy Hunt that will teach you how to connect Cloudflare to your domain and configure various security features, such as HTTPS.</p>

      <p>Once I connected my domain to Cloudflare, I needed to connect Cloudflare to my Droplet. Navigate to the <code>DNS</code> tab on your selected website.</p>

      <p>Record Type:
      <code>A</code></p>

      <p>Name:
      <code>@</code> (Will automatically become domain, i.e tristangoodell.com)</p>

      <p>Value:
      <code>xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx</code> (Will be the IP address of your Droplet)</p>

      <p>TTL:
      <code>Automatic</code></p>

      <p>Finally, ensure that there is an orange cloud under "Status". This means that your website actually goes through Cloudflare's trademark caching.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>One thing though: Be extremely patient</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>When I did this, it took a good day and half for this to consistantly work. I kept modifying my DNS settings, which simply made the wait even longer. Your domain should be connected to your Droplet through Cloudflare after a couple of hours to a full day.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Well, https://tristangoodell.com is now up and running and looks quite pretty. I will be making several key changes over the coming weeks and months that I really hope improve the look and quality of the site. A couple of key features that are missing at the time of this writing are:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Comments: comments are not operational yet, however they are planned and are a top priority.</li>

      <li>Newsletters: you may have noticed several places asking for your email. You are welcome to register your email, however there is no newsletter yet due to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">legal reasons</a>. When there is a newsletter, those registered will be the first ones to receive it however.</li>

      <li>Other pages: I still need to finish writing the Privacy Policy and About pages for the site. Furthermore, I'd like to create a couple of unique graphics for each and every page. I want to also write up several tags and meta stuff for an improved UI.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you have any suggestions, questions, or feedback, feel free to hit me up on Twitter or shoot an email my way.</p>
