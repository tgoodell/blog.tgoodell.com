        <h1><a id="Joining_TSA_0"></a>Joining TSA</h1>
        <i>Tristan Goodell on <a href="../tags/school.html">School</a> | 24 Jan 2019</i>
        <p>I decided to finally join my high school's TSA club. Not the Transportation Security Administration: the <a href="https://tsaweb.org/">Technology Student Association</a>. My cousin has had a great experience in her chapter and has been suggesting that I join my local chapter for quite a while.</p>
        <p>For those of you who do not know, the Technology Student Association is an international organization that:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>[...] enhances personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In other words, you apply STEM skills to different projects and competitions. A few noteworthy events are "Webmaster", "Digital Video Production", and "Video Game Design".</p>
        <p>"Webmaster" involves a team of three to five designing, building, and launching a website that relates to the given theme. In this case, "<a href="https://tsaweb.org/docs/default-source/themes-and-problems-2018-2019/themes/tsa-high-school-webmaster-design-brief-2019.pdf?sfvrsn=db347459_2">Celebrating the Music</a>". It appears that the goal is to develop a website for a band or musician. Seems interesting. I have a decent amount of experience building websites from scratch. I think that I would perform pretty well in this format.</p>
        <p>Although there is not a listed number of participants for "Digital Video Production", I know for sure that this can potentially be a solo event. This competition warrants the creation of a "Mockumentary". A Mockumentary Depicts fiction in the style of a documentary. That is a peculiar way to tell a story. I have a little bit of experience with the video editor <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/">Kdenlive</a>, but creating a film such as this requires more skills than just video editing. Participating in this event would primarily be a learning experience.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have "Video Game Design". A team of three develop a video game that focuses on a chosen theme. Said theme is a role playing game (RPG) that is TSA focussed. According to the video provided, an RPG is a video game 'where the player controls the actions of a character and/or the actions of several party members in a well-defined world'. "TSA focussed" can apparently be as simple as TSA icons appearing in the game. I can see this event end up as a superb learning experience for myself. I have toyed with the idea of building my own video game (I sort of did a few years ago; it was not very good). This would give me an excuse to do it.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Overall, I am pretty excited to join TSA. It will be a novel experience that I believe will be quite captivating. I am wanting to branch out to different clubs and activities since, prior to this, I have really only actively participated in the <a href="https://maumelledebateandspeech.club/">Maumelle Debate and Speech Club</a>. I dabbled with Quiz Bowl and NJHS, however those never went anywhere.</p>
        <p>Well, I will keep you posted. Thanks for reading!</p>
